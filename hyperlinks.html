    <h2>What I have learned in HTML</h2>

    <p> During the first to weeks of html coding I have learned the basics and short cuts of html.
        Html is really simple to use and has everything preload, so that each tag in html
        displays all necessary content needs to execute each command. I leanred structure is important when
        coding, therefore before I start each coding challenge I map out the structure on a piece of paper
        so that I am able to keep track of what I am doing. Taking notes is another value tool to make use of because
        there how so many different html tags, ways of using them and ways of inputting data within the tags.
        It allows me to go back to the specific chapter to recall how a particular tag is used and how it functions.
        working with someone is also helpful because the next person might have ideas or methods that I never thought of.
        One of the most important things I learned was to make use the of the resources at my disposal because all the
        information I need is there to be discovered, all it takes is too put a bit of effort in so that it can be discovered.
